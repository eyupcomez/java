* Basic reason for using methods is avoiding repeating ourselves.
* I tried leet code today and ı failed without even being able to try a code. It was due to not knowing what works for what. I relaized that I only know syntaxes. I have no idea and understanding of algorithyms. Shame on myself. But I think I will change this. Once I get relatively comfortable with the syntax of the java, I’ll jum into learning data structures and basic algoritthyms such as sorting, searching, recursion and basic problem solving tecniques.
* void operations are used to have computer do something.
* I guess methods with parameters used for retuning something. If there is parameters it’s likely I am going to return soemthing.
* If I want to return more than one argument in method I can use variable arguments. I can do so by adding 3 dots in front of the variable type.
Sample:
public Static int addup(int… numbers){}
* Classes can also store attributes. 
* Getters are return statements. They are used to make private attributes public. 
* Setters are void operations. U can use them to allow user to make changes on app. 
* this function states the variable in assigned class.
